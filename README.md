$ python3 server.py
```

Then open http://127.0.0.1:8000/ in browser.

TODO:
- lag compensation: playing tracks don't change when slider moves, hard to find correct value
- overlap recordings longer than one track length (2 track lengths enough?)
- darker css?
- download button
- network multiplayer lol
- cuts off too quickly when you click stop
