TODO:
- metronome sound https://freesound.org/people/unfa/sounds/243749/
- make lag compensation adjustable instead of hard-coded 0.1sec
- deleting and muting tracks (don't always choose next free channel out of 32 channels)
- track-specific volume sliders
- latency slider
- overlap recordings longer than one track length (2 track lengths enough?)
- css
- bpm chooser
- download button
- network multiplayer lol
