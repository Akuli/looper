TODO:
- visualizing the audio
- moving tracks by drag and drop
- lag compensation: playing tracks don't change when slider moves, hard to find correct value
- overlap recordings longer than one track length (2 track lengths enough?)
- renaming tracks
- darker css?
- bpm chooser
- download button
- network multiplayer lol
