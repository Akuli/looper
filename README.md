# Looper

This is like a loop pedal, but in the browser.
[Click here](https://akuli.github.io/looper/) to use it.

## Development

```
$ python3 server.py
```

Then open http://localhost:8000/ in browser.

TODO:
- remember previous bpm and beat count
- add spinner while waiting
- index.html: sane minimum and maximum values for spinboxes
- lag compensation: playing tracks don't change when slider moves, hard to find correct value
- darker css?
